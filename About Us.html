						<h3>The origin of Nail</h3>
		<p>	Beautiful nails are considered a precious gift that is respected and cared for. In Greek mythology, Than Eros was identified as the first nail worker. Eros cut

The goddess's nails Aphrodite when the goddess is sleeping and spreading them on the beaches on earth. Last time, fate has collected and turned them into stones

Agate - And that is also a Greek called "nails". Actually, human nails - are hard horns covering the back of the fingertips and toes - already

Evolution from primitive claws. In folk beliefs, nails are often thought to continue to grow after death, temporarily not ruined. Therefore,

Long nails are typical of vampires, and others have "immortal" status. This phenomenon is in fact due to the dehydration of corpses causing the skin around

The nails are shrinking and shrinking, but the alarming effect of this special decomposition aspect has inspired countless stories of sick horror in

Those who are buried to scratch their lives out of the grave. Nails, along with the dead bones, hair and teeth, like Sir Thomas Browne have noted in the century

XVII, it's "the treasure of the ancient magicians" and one of the oldest poisoned forms is to grasp the victim's food or wine.

Even today people are also used to disinfect scratches, perhaps because nails actually contain a small percentage of arsenic.

			Art Nail Art History - Art Nail

Origin of nail jobs

The nail practice is extremely ancient. There was evidence that 4,000 years ago, nail jobs took place in southern Babylonia and manicure tools

Found in Egyptian royal graves. The Romans have painted nails with a mixture of sheep and blood. Turkish women have created a pink tone for

Nails from boiled rose petals. Women in the Bible are not only hair dyeing but also nail polish and pedicure as well as hand and legs with Henna

(As mentioned in Solomon's Saint Vinh), it is still part of the Middle Eastern culture today. Custom cultivation customs related to position

Social, because people often have nails will not have to work. Chinese nobility and women in the town (1368-1644) are famous for special long nails, sometimes

Nails are protected with gold and jewel encrusted nail guards. The waiter is required to feed, wear clothes and perform personal jobs

Other for them so they don't break their nails. Chinese people also use nail polish made from egg whites, beeswax, plant dyes and Arabic gum.</p>

		<p>
	In the Western hemisphere of color nail polish is not popular until the twentieth century. Instead, the hand is uncertain with white nails and is often considered part

The aesthetic dominates the body to clean body and pure morality. Guide to this sanitation ritual since the 1800s recommend a little lemon juice or

Vinegar and water to whiten nail heads and commercial products available at this time include nail polish or cushion, crystal stone, chalk board, hand cream and

Epips, pearl white liquid, and some kind of bleached powder for hands and nails. This absence of this clear jewelry is an indicator of wealth and

Entertainment is valuable. For example, Emma Bovpry's nails are cleansing more ivory dieppe and cutting virtuous shapes. "

		<p>
		Innovation of nail polish


Hollywood movies have done more than any other visual means to disseminate nail polish in the West. The film actress of the 1920s

Looking strange, symbolizing the modernity and festival nails painted with colorful balls soon commercialized. Literally, new lacquer

Nails are mixed membranes that have been cleaned with alcohol and castor oil and so that this mixture soaks overnight. The first nail polish colors are produced with sharp

Exquisite pink and names like "commission", "Ruby", "coral" and "natural"
		
		</p>
 <p>
Deep-colored polishes such as Cardinal Red are not available until the 1930s, when Charles Revson and his colleagues have developed a method to add opaque pigments (instead of dyes) to polish Let it cover all the nails.</p>
<p>
Their company, Revlon Inc., is still one of the leading nail polishers, becoming particularly famous for the legendary "fire and ice" advertising campaign these

1950. Ads for a variety of suitable nail polish and lipsticks have been using impressive images and smart text and are considered one

The first cosmetics link public sex with sex. A typical header runs "for those who like to flirt with fire who dare to skip on thin tape." Like

As many cosmetic advertisements during this period, Revlon's marketing has exploited a variety of meanings of nail decoration. Nail polish is part of the page

The feminine self-examination depends on the approval of men, but they are also related to the idea of ​​increasingly free about a modern woman looking

fun.</p>
	<p>

The past few decades have witnessed further innovation and fashion in Western nail art. Manufacturers have created quick-drying polishes aimed at women

There is a dynamic lifestyle, and the range of colors available has increased with a bumper. From the 1980s onwards, vibrant color polish was available in other colors, from chalk

Cream color to gray gunmetal, along with polishers containing integrated ornaments like sparkling or small metal stars. In 1995, Chanel was

Bring these colors become the main color when the color of dark red paint. "VAMP" continues to connect Hollywood when actress UMA Thurman in Pulp movie

Fiction used it the same year. For $ 15 a bottle, Sonel's paint has helped to create a market for high-priced nail products and pave the way for

Success of companies like Urban Decay and Hard Candy - create great profits from producing strange color testing for nails. In 1998, Jenai Lane of America

has created "mood nail polish" designed to change the color according to the body temperature - reflecting the mood of a person.</p>

<p>
More than 6 billion dollars are spent on services at US nail salons every year and art workers' arts are increasingly appreciated around the world. Men also
